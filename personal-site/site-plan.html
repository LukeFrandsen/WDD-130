      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>

      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Clearly difines what this site is for including a logo and its main
        duties. The copy right for images with be clearly defineed at the bottom
        of the page.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
      <img
        class="home-page-photo"
        src="images/worldsteel-Padma-Bridge.jpeg"
        alt="image for homepage"
      />

      <h3>Entertainment</h3>
      <p>
        Users can categorize their connections based on their preferences and
        needs. For instance, they can create categories like "Work," "Social
        Media," "Finance," and "Entertainment," and place the relevant websites
        under these headings. This feature not only saves time but also enhances
        productivity by allowing users to find exactly what they need without
        any hassle.

      <h3>Business</h3>
      <p>
        Another significant advantage of my website is that it answers the
        essential question of how to connect to different sites. Many users,
        especially those who are not tech-savvy, often struggle with remembering
        URLs or navigating through multiple steps to log into their accounts. My
        website simplifies this process by providing clear instructions and
        direct links to various sites. Whether you need to reset your password,
        find a specific feature on a social media platform, or navigate through
        an online banking site, my website offers guidance every step of the
        way.
